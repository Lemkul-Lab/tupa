# RAIJIN : Electric field analysis for molecular simulations

## What is ***Raijin***?
***Raijin*** is a python algorithm that employs MDanalysis engine to calculate Electric Field at any point inside
the simulation box throughout MD trajectories. ***Raijin*** also includes a PyMOL plugin to visualize electric
field vectors in your simulation box.

Required packages:

* MDanalysis >= 1.0.0
* Python     >= 3.x
* Numpy      >= 1.2.x


## Installation instructions
------------------------------

First, make sure you have all required packages installed. For MDanalysis installation procedures, [click here](https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/installation_quick_start/).

After, just clone this repository into a folder of your choice:

    git clone https://github.com/mdpoleto/raijin.git

To use ***Raijin*** easily, copy the directory pathway to ***Raijin*** folder and include an alias in your ~/.bashrc:

    alias raijin="python /path/to/the/cloned/repository/raijin.py"

To install the PyMOL plugin, open PyMOL > Plugin Manager and click on "Install New Plugin" tab.
Load the ***Raijin*** plugin and use it via command-line within PyMOL. To usage instructions, read our FAQ.


## Raijin Usage
------------------------------
***Raijin*** calculations are based on parameters that are provided via a configuration file,
which can be obtained via the command:

    raijin -template config.conf


The configuration file usually contains:
    [Elecfield Selection]
    sele_elecfield      = (string)             [default: None]

    [Target Selection]
    mode                = (string)             [default: None]
    selatom             = (string)             [default: None]
    selbond1            = (string)             [default: None]
    selbond2            = (string)             [default: None]
    targetcoordinate    = [float,float,float]  [default: None]
    remove_self         = (True/False)         [default: False]

    [Solvent]
    include_solvent     = (True/False)         [default: False]
    solvent_cutoff      = (float)              [default: None]
    solvent_selection   = (string)             [default: None]

    [Time]
    begintime           = (integer)            [default: 0]
    endtime             = (integer)            [default: None]
    dt                  = (integer)            [default: 1]
    skip                = (integer)            [default: 1]


A complete explanation of each option in the configuration file is available via the command:

    raijin -h

***Raijin*** has 3 calculations MODES:

* In ***ATOM*** mode, the coordinate of one atom will be tracked throughout the trajectory to serve as target point.
If more than 1 atom is provided in the selection, the center of geometry (COG) is used as target position. An example
is provided HERE.

* In ***BOND*** mode, the midpoint between 2 atoms will be tracked throughout the trajectory to serve as target
point. In ***BOND*** mode, the bond axis is used to calculate electric field alignment. By default, the bond axis is
define as **selbond1 ---> selbond2**. An example is provided HERE.

* In ***COORDINATE*** mode, a list of [X,Y,Z] coordinates will serve as target point in all trajectory frames.
An example is provided HERE.

***IMPORTANT***:
* All selections must be compatible with MDAnalysis syntax.
* If using COORDINATE mode, make sure your trajectory has no translations and rotations. Our code does not account for
rotations and translations.


## Raijin PyMOL Plugin
------------------------------

To install ***Raijin*** plugin in PyMOL, click on Plugin > Plugin Manager and then "Install New Plugin" tab.
Choose the ***pymol_raijin_plugin.py*** file and click Install.

Our plugin has 3 functions:

* ***efield_point***: create a vector at a given atom or set of coordinates.
```
efield_point resid 160 and name OG, efield=[-1.179143125383e+02, 1.503252874309e+02, 8.655535020725e+01], scale=0.01, color="red", name="efield_OG"
```

* ***efield_bond***: create a vector midway between 2 selected atoms.
```
efield_point resid 160 and name OG, resname LIG and name C1, efield=[-9.42675084e+01, -9.67221993, 5.82067073e+01], scale=0.01, color="blue", name="efield_OG-C1"
```

* ***draw_bond_axis***: create a vector representing the axis between 2 atoms.
```
draw_bond_axis resid 160 and name OG, resname LIG and name C1, gap=0.5, color="gray60", name="axis_OG-C1"
```
